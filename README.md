Year Up Week 2 - Capstone Assessment: Build an E-commerce Website
## Description
Sanrio-inspired online shop for all the Hello Kitty and Friends Fan with classic and limited edition plushies.
It's not completely responsive, just a demo for my assessment. It was built for educational purposes using prior knowledge on VS code.
Also used Bootstrap and w3schools for the first time as a resource. Through the process, I learned to use GitHub, explored Bootstrap, and familiarized myself with it for efficient use.

## note 
an interesting HTML I wrote was 
 <div class="row">
      <div class="col1  sm-2 md-6 lg-12">
        <a href="ALL.html"><img src="image/894923-Zoom.1_2000x.jpg" alt="all products sanrio">   ALL</a> <Br> <hr>
        <a href="Categories.html"><img src="image/hellokitty1.jpg" alt="hellokitty1">  <span style="margin-right: 55px;">Hello Kitty</span></a>
        <a href="Categories.html"><img src="image/kuromibuildabear.jpg" alt="kuromi plush">   Build-A-Bear</a><br>
        <a href="Categories.html"><img src="image/keychain.jpg" alt="keychain">   Keychain Dangler</a>
        <a href="Categories.html"><img src="image/squichmallow.jpg" alt="squichmallow">   Squishmallow</a>
        </div>
    </div> 
    because we learned this in class and how to use sm- md- lg- to fit different screens and I managed to make it into my product category links and included an image for each
