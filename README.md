Year Up Week 2 - Capstone Assessment: Build an E-commerce Website
## Description
Sanrio-inspired online shop for all the Hello Kitty and Friends Fan with classic and limited edition plushies.
It's not completely responsive, just a demo for my assessment. It was built for educational purposes using prior knowledge on VS code.
Also used Bootstrap and w3schools for the first time as a resource. Through the process, I learned to use GitHub, explored Bootstrap, and familiarize myself with it for efficient use.
